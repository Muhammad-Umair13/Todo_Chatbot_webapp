[["specification", "database", "schema"], ["NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n- All requirements are testable and unambiguous\n- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic\n- All acceptance scenarios defined\n- Edge cases identified (validation, ownership, error handling)\n- Scope clearly bounded\n- Dependencies and assumptions identified\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u2705 Impact: Established clear, testable requirements for Phase II database schema focused on user value and business needs\n- \ud83e\uddea Tests: No tests created during specification phase; acceptance scenarios defined for future testing\n- \ud83d\udcc1 Files: Created specs/003-database-schema/spec.md and quality validation checklist\n- \ud83d\udd01 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.clarify` (if any clarifications needed) or `/sp.plan` to proceed with implementation planning\n- \ud83e\udde0 Reflection: Successfully transformed technical database constraints into user-centric specification without implementation details\n\n## Evaluation notes (flywheel)\n\n- Failure modes observed: None - specification creation completed successfully\n- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality validation checklist - PASS (all items met)\n- Prompt variant (if applicable): Default specification generation flow\n- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None - specification is complete and ready for next phase"]]
